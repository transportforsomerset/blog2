      The Taunton to Weston-super-Mare section of the railway is closed for the week, starting from
      Monday 3rd until Friday 7th February 2025.
    </p>

    <p>
      Network Rail have closed the section between Taunton, Bridgwater, Highbridge & Burnham and Weston-super-Mare,
      to allow them to repair railway bridges that cross the line in various places.
    </p>

    <p>
      GWR services that usually operate between Taunton and Weston-super-Mare will be replaced by railway buses, whereas
      services that operate between the South West of England and London won't be affected.
    </p>

    <p>CrossCrountry services will continue to operate, but will divert from Taunton via Westbury, with journey times being extended.</p>
